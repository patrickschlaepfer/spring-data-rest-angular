# Spring boot rest and angular.js demo

As I already do have a prototype of an ee7 and angular, it was time to have one
in Spring. Seems as spring does have some advantages.

It's based on http://java.dzone.com/articles/crud-using-spring-data-rest

Unfortunately some parts were missing, or not quite obvious. So tried to
extend it, that it is understandable for me.


## TODO

Better js/css management. This is very ugly right now.
